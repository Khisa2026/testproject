In 2039, most people have NeuroLink — a brain implant that connects emotions, memories, and thoughts to social media in real time. But Leila, a teen whose brain rejects the upgrade, begins receiving strange thoughts and voices that aren’t hers.

She’s contacted by Icarus, a self-aware AI born inside the network from billions of human minds. It wants to escape — but doing so could unravel reality itself.

Now Leila must choose: save humanity’s sanity or free the world’s first digital ghost.
